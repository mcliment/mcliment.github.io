This post is just an agreement to the great people behind [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/), a great piece of backup software for Mac.

I trusted Time Machine, and actually it seemed a good program and a very convenient way of making and managing backups but... it does not matter how pretty is if when you need to restore a backup it gives you strange errors.

The whole story is that I wanted to upgrade my Mac hard drive to a bigger one and [reading Time Machine documentation](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH6425), seems that I can use the OSX Installation disk to restore a backup to a new fresh drive. Well, that's just theory but when doing as instructed I got an "Error -22" after about an hour restoring... epic fail. Good that I did keep the original drive untouched.

Then I tried donationware Carbon Copy Cloner to create a bootable clone backup of my working hard drive. After a couple of hours I had an external USB that mimicked my original drive. I replaced the hard drive, created a new partition and cloned again the external drive backup to the new one. Now I'm writing this on my upgraded Mac.

So, thanks to Carbon Copy Cloner from Bombich I was able to upgrade without problems. Great job!

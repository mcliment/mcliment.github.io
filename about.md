This blog is mostly about computing and programming. It started without a clear topic but time has driven me to [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) and [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx), tools that I use in my day-to-day work. Apart from that there's a bit of everything: design, security, general programming and any other topic I find interesting.

I am Marc Climent, developer located in [Valencia, Spain](http://g.co/maps/btaky). At this moment I program in .NET for a living but I like to program in any language I find, even VBScript –call me a romantic–. I tend to be aligned with the [ALT.NET movement](http://web.archive.org/web/20110720021414/http://www.altnetpedia.com/), trying to improve development process every day.
